Fourth Part: Integration of Advanced Features and Interactive Animations in the Movie Application


In this fourth stage of the movie application project, we will focus on integrating advanced features and interactive animations to optimize the user experience and add value to the existing architecture. The purpose of this phase is for the student to develop advanced skills in expanding a pre-existing project, simulating the professional context of a full-stack developer inheriting code from a colleague and adapting to the project’s continuity. This experience is crucial not only for developing advanced technical skills but also for gaining a comprehensive understanding of collaboration in agile, multifunctional environments where efficient integration with other developers’ work is required. The ability to assess and adapt pre-existing code is essential to ensuring the scalability and long-term maintenance of complex applications.



In this phase, the student will face real integration and optimization challenges, developing skills in critical code reading, understanding predefined structures, and collaborative expansion, all of which are essential elements for success in professional development projects. The focus on adapting features and incorporating new ones allows for deepening key aspects of full-stack development, such as component interoperability, module reuse, and continuous improvement of performance and user experience. Additionally, new technologies and animation techniques will be implemented to further enrich the application, promoting a more immersive and sophisticated user experience. The implementation of these advanced technologies will not only optimize the usability and appearance of the project but also incorporate modern development practices that ensure a smooth and engaging user interaction.



Upon completing this phase, students will have had the opportunity to participate in the evolution of a project, experiencing first-hand the challenges of expanding an application with an already established set of features. Additionally, students will be encouraged to critically reflect on design decisions, optimization, and the best development practices implemented throughout the process, enriching their understanding of the software lifecycle and the importance of efficient collaboration in professional environments. The goal is that, by the end of this phase, students will be able to demonstrate a deeper technical understanding of advanced application development, the use of interactive animations, and the collaborative process for improving and evolving web applications.



General Objective
As a future full-stack developer, an important part of your job will be to take on a project initiated by another developer or team member. You must be able to familiarize yourself with the existing code, which may take some time, and it is even advisable to rework some parts to better understand how it functions if the project is not very large. In this peer-to-peer (P2P) project, you are expected to take on a project that has already been started, with some components implemented, and meet a series of objectives established by the client.

To achieve these objectives, we will use some of the techniques learned in previous phases, as well as new libraries that will allow us to enrich our project. We will use libraries such as Swiper, AnimeJS, and Interact.js to add animations and interactive features, improving both the aesthetics and usability of the application.
